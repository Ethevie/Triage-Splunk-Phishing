Phishing alert investigation using Splunk and TryHackMe
# Triage: Splunk Phishing Investigation

This project demonstrates how I used Splunk to investigate phishing alerts based on data from a TryHackMe lab. It includes screenshots of the alert triage process, dashboards, and analysis steps I followed to detect and respond to potential threats.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Splunk
- TryHackMe (SOC Lab)
- VirtualBox (Kali VM)
- GitHub

## 📚 What I Did
- Reviewed phishing email indicators
- Used Splunk search queries to investigate alerts
- Identified a true positive based on threat score and geolocation
- Built a dashboard to monitor suspicious activity
- Documented each step of the triage process

## 📷 Screenshots
Check the `screenshots/` folder to see examples of the alerts and Splunk dashboards.
